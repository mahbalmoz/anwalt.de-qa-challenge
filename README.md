# Task description
## Find bugs using manual testing

Take a big / common website of your choice and find at least five bugs by manual testing.
Bugs should be both in areas of user interfaces as well as in logical topics.

## Automate multiple test-cases

While you were looking at the website of your choice, you might have found functionality which is ideal to be checked using automated tests.
Write four automated tests. Two should be failing, two should be green. In the end there should be a repository which we can download and execute.

# Environment
- Docker as container management tool can be used but it's not a must
- Choose a framework like selenium, cypress or something similar
- Feel free to set up a little taskrunner / pipline. 

# Project delivery

- Project must have clear instructions on how to set up, install dependencies and run.
- Git should be used as a VCS. Please send us the link to the repository or a zip-file.
- Feel free to ask questions regarding the requirements.
